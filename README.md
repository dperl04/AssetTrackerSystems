# AssetTrackerSystems
This to be further updated. 
This project uses Flask and SQLAlchemy to attempt to create the website and server side portions of the Asset Tracker System.

There are code comments litter about the code that give insight, some older than others.

The folder within that folder that contains files that will be directly used in the final project is the drs-asset-tracking one, which is a flask app that is working towards being the website DRS asked for. The folder assetTracker within it is where all the code is store pretty much, the other directories are more for website operation, except for Tests, which is for tests. Not that I've used it for tests because I skipped that part of the tutorial. 

Database Stuff's databasev1TESTPERMA.py, while not in use directly, has had much of its code cut and paste into models.py and dbCommands.py, but much also hasn't and modified bits of it may be needed to make the program do everything it needs to.
